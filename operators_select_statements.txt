1. Write out a generic SELECT statement.

    SELECT name, grade
    FROM students
    WHERE name LIKE 'A%'
    AND grade > 89;



2. Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.
    
    FROM --------- Fancy
    WHERE -------- White
    GROUP BY ----- Girls
    HAVING ------- Have
    SELECT ------- Small
    DISTINCT ----- Dog
    ORDER BY ----- Obsessions
    TOP ---------- Typically.
    


3. Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

    Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.
    
      SELECT name, age, gender
      FROM dogs
      WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%';

    
    Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.
    
      SELECT id
      FROM dogs
      WHERE age < 1;
    
    
    Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.
    
      SELECT name, age
      FROM dogs
      WHERE gender = 'F' 
      AND weight > 35;

    
    Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.
      
      SELECT *
      FROM dogs
      WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

    
    Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.
    
     Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

      SELECT id, age, weight, breed
      FROM dogs
      WHERE weight > 60
      OR breed LIKE '%great date%';
      
        

4. Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

    SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;
    
      |  Mushi     |  2016-03-22T00:00:00.000Z  |
      |  Seashell  |	null                      |
      |  Azul      |  2016-04-17T00:00:00.000Z  |
      |  Victoire  |  2016-09-01T00:00:00.000Z  |
      |  Nala      |  null                      |

    
    SELECT name, age FROM cats;

      |  Mushi     |  1  |
      |  Seashell  |  7  |
      |  Azul      |  3  |
      |  Victoire  |  7  |
      |  Nala      |  1  |



5. From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.

    Display all the information about all of the available cats.

      SELECT * 
      FROM cats 
      WHERE adoption_date IS NULL;
    
    
    Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.
      
      SELECT name, gender
      FROM cats
      WHERE age = 7;
      
      
    Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.
    
      SELECT name
      FROM cats;



6. List each comparison operator and explain, in your own words, when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.

    If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!
