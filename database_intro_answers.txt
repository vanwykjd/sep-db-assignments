1. What data types do each of these values represent? 

  "A Clockwork Orange" : varchar(n)
  42 : integer
  09/02/1945 :  date / varchar(n)
  98.7 : float 
  $15.99 : currency / float / varchar(n)
    
  


2. Explain in your own words when a database might be used. Explain when a text file might be used.

  A database would be used to keep track of important data for a company, such as employee information. A company could keep track of employee data by creating
  a table made up of rows representing each of its employees, and columns describing the attributes desired to associated with each employee (ID, Name, Phone, Email...).
  A text file would be used when information is needing to be capable of being read by humans. Usually these files explain a set of instructions, or describes particular components of a program.
    
  


3. Describe one difference between SQL and other programming languages.

  Programming languages are used to write lines code that are meant to solve problems in a procedural manner. The programmer has to declare what lines are to be executed when a certain output is desired.
  SQL is a nonprocedural language, giving it the ability to perform tasks without having specifying how they are to be accomplished. 
  
  


4. In your own words, explain how the pieces of a database system fit together at a high level.

  Databases organize data using table structures. These tables are made up of cells that are placed in corresponding columns and rows;
  The columns indicate the data types and a name that describes the data they contain, and the rows contain the records of complete units that have attributes described by the columns.
  Cells contain the actual values of data, and are located at the intersection of each column and row.
  
  


5. Explain the meaning of table, row, column, and value.

  Table:  A table is a structure consisting of columns and rows. Each table represents a collection of records that contain the same attributes.
  Row:  A row is an instance of a complete record that is made up of different attributes, and represent a set of related data values. Each row within the same table contain the same attributes and structure.
  Column: A column describes the name of an attribute given to a record, and determines the data type of the described attribute.
  Value: A value is at the intersection of each column and row. It belongs to the record indicated by the row, and is described by the column of which it is in.
  
  


6. List 3 data types that can be used in a table.

  Binary, Boolean, Real
  
  


7. Given this payments table, provide an English description of the following queries and include their results:
  
  >>  SELECT date, amount
  >>  FROM payments;
  
  Select the "date" and "amount" from every payment within the "payments" table.
  The result returns every record's "date" and "amount" that is within the "payments" table.
  
  
  >>  SELECT amount
  >>  FROM payments
  >>  WHERE amount > 500;
  
  Select the payments that have an "amount" greater than 500 within the "payments" table.
  The result shows that there is one payment with an "amount" value of "1500", within the "payments" table.
  
  
  >>  SELECT *
  >>  FROM payments
  >>  WHERE payee = 'Mega Foods';
  
  Select all of the columns for a payment where the "payee" is equal to "Mega Foods" within the "payments" table.
  The result returns all the columns associated with a payment where "payee" is equal to "Mega Foods"
  
  


8. Given this users table, write SQL queries using the following criteria and include the output:
